F.A.Q.
===

Q. Why did create this?

A. HackerQueue was created because it gets annoying to go to more than one site for news, especially when you like to read a lot.

Q. Why does HackerQueue only display these three sites?

A. HackerQueue is currently purposed for news about Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Networking, and their cultures.  The direction I wish for it to take may change in the future though.

Q. Will HackerQueue ever support posts?

A. If enough users are accumulated.

Q. What if I want more sites to be added?

A. Please create an issue report and mark it as an enhancement.  I will look into it.  If the site is related to Comp Sci/Comp Eng/ Networking or their cultures I will probably add it when I get free time.
